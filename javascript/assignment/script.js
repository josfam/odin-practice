/* 2. Add a sequence of 6 different numbers together. */

Print the solution to the following equation: (4 + 6 + 9) / 77

Let’s use variables!
	Type this statement at the top of the script tag: let a = 10
	In the console console.log(a) should print 10
	Try the following in the console: 9 * a
	and this: let b = 7 * a (returns undefined *) and then console.log(b)

/*
You should be getting the hang of this by now… try this sequence:
	Declare a constant variable MAX with the value 57
	Set another variable actual to MAX - 13
	Set another variable percentage to actual / MAX
	If you type percentage in the console and press Enter you should see a value like 0.7719
